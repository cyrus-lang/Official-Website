# Install compiler binary 

Cyrus provides prebuilt binaries for major platforms, available on our GitHub releases page.

<br />

## 1. Download the Latest Release

Head over to the releases page and grab the archive for your platform:

- Linux (x86_64 / ARM64)
- Windows (x86_64)
- MacOS (Intel / Apple Silicon)

<br />

## 2. Extract the Zip file

After downloading the release archive from GitHub releases, you need to extract it.

So you can run Cyrus from anywhere, move the binary to a directory in your PATH:

```bash
sudo mv cyrus /usr/local/bin
```

Cyrus requires access to its standard library. Copy it to a known location (e.g. ~/.cyrus_stdlib):

```bash
cp -r ./stdlib ~/.cyrus_stdlib
```

Then export the path in your shell config (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.):

```bash
export CYRUS_STDLIB=~/.cyrus_stdlib
```

Apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc # or source ~/.zshrc
```

<br />

## 3. Verify the Installation

Check the compiler works:

```bash
cyrus version
```

Expected output: 

```bash
Cyrus vX.Y.Z
```
