# Install Compiler binary

<br></br>

To start using Cyrus programming language you need to install its compiler.

It's pretty simple, just follow the steps based on your OS (Windows/Linux/MacOS).

<br></br>
<br></br>

## GNU/Linux distributions
    <br></br>
    After you downloaded Cyrus compiler from <a href="google.com"> This link </a>, 
    extract it and move to extracted directory (where you can see install.sh file) and
    run this command in your shell:

    ```bash
    sudo ./install.sh
    ```

    <br></br>

    if installation is successfull you should see this:
    
    ```bash
    Cyrus has been installed successfully!
    ```
