# Roadmap

Stay up to date with the **Cyrus compiler development**! Our public roadmap tracks every milestone, feature, and improvement as we evolve the language.

Below are the three main areas of focus for Cyrus:

<br />

## 1. Initial Compiler

The initial compiler is the foundation of Cyrus. It includes the basic syntax, parsing, and core language features. This phase ensures that the language is **stable, performant, and ready for early experiments**.

Check out the full initial compiler roadmap on GitHub:

## 2. Self-Hosted Compiler

The self-hosted compiler is the next step, where Cyrus is capable of compiling **itself**. This milestone is critical for testing the language in **real-world scenarios** and improving compiler optimizations.

## 3. Standard Library

The standard library provides **essential data structures, utilities, and APIs** for developers. This phase ensures that Cyrus can support **practical programming tasks** while maintaining **clarity, performance, and safety**.
