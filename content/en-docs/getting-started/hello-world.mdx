# Hello World!

It’s finally time for every programmer’s first program: **Hello World!**

<br></br>

You can create a basic Cyrus project using the Cyrus compiler. Just run this in your shell:

```bash
cyrus new hello-world
```

This command creates a new Cyrus project named `hello-world`.
<br></br>

Every Cyrus project follows this structure:
```bash
    src/
        main.cyr
    .gitignore
    Project.toml
```

- `main.cyr` is where your program starts.
- `Project.toml` contains project metadata and settings.
- `.gitignore` is optional and used for Git version control.
<br></br>
To run the project, navigate into the project directory and run:
```bash
cyrus run
```

Cyrus source files use the `.cyr` extension. The compiler expects a `main.cyr` file as the project’s entry point.
<br></br>
## Writing Hello World

If you want to write the code yourself, open `main.cyr` and add the following:

```cyrus
func main() {
    printf("Hello World!");
}
```
<br></br>
### What does this code do?

- `main()` is the entry point. Cyrus runs this function first.
- `printf()` is a built-in function that prints text to your terminal.

That’s it — you’ve successfully written your first Cyrus program!  
Now you're ready to build more.
