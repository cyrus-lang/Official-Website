# Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for Cyrus. Here you'll find everything you need to get started with our modern, expressive, and efficient programming language.

Cyrus is designed for developers who want the power of low-level control without sacrificing clarity. Its syntax is concise and approachable, while its compiler ensures performance and safety through modern optimizations. Whether you’re building high-performance systems, experimenting with algorithms, or exploring creative projects, Cyrus gives you the tools to express ideas cleanly and run them efficiently.

<br />

### Why Cyrus?

- Expressiveness - Code should feel natural to read and write, without unnecessary ceremony.
- Performance - The compiler generates optimized native code, making Cyrus suitable for demanding workloads.
- Simplicity - A small but powerful core, with a standard library that grows with your needs, not against them.

<br />

## A Quick Taste

Here's a glimpse of what Cyrus code looks like:

```cyrus
import std::io;

func main() {
  #msg: char* = "Hello, Cyrus!";
  io::printfn(msg);
}
```
