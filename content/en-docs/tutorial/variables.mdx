# Variables

Variables in Cyrus are declared using the # symbol:

```cyrus
#name: OptionalType = Value;
```

- **#name** - the variable name, always prefixed with #
- **OptionalType** - (optional) the type of the variable; if omitted, the compiler infers it
- **Value** - the initial value assigned to the variable

Example

```cyrus
#count: int = 42;                   // explicit type annotation
#message: char* = "Hello, Cyrus!";  // explicit type annotation
#flag = true;                       // type inferred as bool
```

<br />

## Why Sharp (#)?

The # prefix is unique to Cyrus. It makes variable declarations easy to spot and improves editor syntax highlighting.   
Using # instead of keywords like var or let keeps code shorter and visually distinct.   
Type inference works automatically when the type is omitted.

## Zero Initialization

Variables that are declared without an initial value are automatically zero-initialized:

```cyrus
#x: int;
#y: float64;
#ptr: int*;

printf("%d\n", x);   // prints 0
printf("%f\n", y);   // prints 0.0
printf("%p\n", ptr); // prints null / 0
```

<br />

## Variable Mutability

In Cyrus, variables are mutable by default. You can assign new values to them after their initial declaration:

```cyrus
#counter: int = 0;
#counter = 10; // allowed
```

To declare a **read-only variable**, use the const keyword before the type:

```cyrus
#pi: const float64 = 3.14159;
```

- Const Type variables cannot be reassigned after initialization.
- Must be initialized at the time of declaration; leaving it uninitialized is not allowed.

```cyrus
#pi: const float64; // ❌ const variable must be initialized
#pi = 3.14159;      // ❌ cannot assign to const variable
```
