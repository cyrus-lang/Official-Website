# Basic Syntax

This article is an introduction to the Cyrus Programming Language. It assumes you already have a basic understanding of programming concepts such as variables, statements, and types. Here, you’ll see how familiar ideas are expressed in Cyrus, while also being introduced to new concepts that make the language unique.

If you haven't installed Cyrus yet, start with the [Getting Started](/en/docs/getting-started/install-compiler-binary) guide before continuing.

<br />

## Comments

Comments are pieces of text ignored by the compiler.
They're useful for explaining code, leaving notes, or temporarily disabling parts of a program. Cyrus supports both single-line and multi-line comments.

- Single-line Comments

```cyrus
// This is a single-line comment
var msg: char* = "Hello, Cyrus!"; // You can also place it after code
```

- Multi-line Comments

```cyrus
/*
  Outer comment start
  /* Nested comment inside */
  Outer comment end

  Multi-line comments can also be nested!
*/
```

<br />

## Const string and Character Literals

String literals in Cyrus are enclosed in double quotes **"xxx"**, while character literals are enclosed in single quotes **'x'**.
Both forms represent sequences of Unicode characters, but they differ in intent and usage:

- String literals produce values of type **char\***, which can hold arbitrarily many characters.
- Character literals produce values of type **char**, which always represent exactly one Unicode scalar value.

```cyrus
var greeting: char* = "Hello, Cyrus!";
var letter: char = 'A';
```

### Escapes

Special characters that are difficult to type directly or would otherwise break the syntax can be written using escape sequences. All escape sequences begin with a backslash (\).

Common escapes include:

- **\n** - newline (line feed, U+000A)
- **\t** - horizontal tab (U+0009)
- **\r** - carriage return (U+000D)
- **\b** - backspace (U+0008)
- **\a** - bell/alert (U+0007)
- **\v** - vertical tab (U+000B)
- **\f** - form feed (U+000C)
- **\\** - literal backslash
- **\"** - double quote (inside strings)
- **\'** - single quote (inside chars or strings)

Example:

```cyrus
var poem: char* = "Line one\nLine two\nLine three";
var quote: char* = "She said: \"Cyrus is great!\"";
var backslash: char = '\\';

var paragraph: char* = "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.";
```

<br />

### Unicode and Emojis

Cyrus supports Unicode characters directly in string and character literals. You can type emojis, accented letters, or any other Unicode characters inside quotes:

```cyrus
var letter: char = 'A';                     // ✅ Works
var smile: char* = "😇";                    // ✅ Works in a string
var rocket: string = "Let's go! \u{1F680}"; // ✅ Works, 🚀
var greek_alpha: char* = "\u03B1";          // ✅ Works, α
var emoji_char: char = '😇';                // ❌ Does NOT work
var multibyte_char: char = '\u263A';        // ❌ Does NOT work
```

<br />

## Integer Constants

Numeric constants in Cyrus can be written in **decimal**, **hexadecimal**, **octal**, or **binary** formats:

- Decimal (Base 10):

```cyrus
var a = 1234;
```

- Hexadecimal (Base 16, prefix with 0x or 0X):

```cyrus
var b = 0x42EDAA02;
```

- Binary (Base 2, prefix with 0b or 0B):

```cyrus
var c = 0x42EDAA02;
```

Numeric literals may include underscores **\_** between digits for readability; these are ignored by the compiler:

```cyrus
var million = 1_000_000;
var hex_val = 0xDE_AD_BE_EF;
```

<br />

## Literal Suffixes

Cyrus allows explicit type suffixes on numeric literals to specify their type.
This is useful when the compiler cannot infer the type or when you want to guarantee a specific type.

### Integer Suffixes

Valid integer suffixes include:

- uintptr
- intptr
- size_t
- int
- int8
- int16
- int32
- int64
- int128
- uint
- uint8
- uint16
- uint32
- uint64
- uint128

Valid float suffixes include:

- float16
- float32
- float64
- float128

Example:

```cyrus
var a = 1234int64;
var b = 3.14float64;
```

<br />

### Default Type of Literals

If you don't specify a type suffix, Cyrus assigns **int** as the default type for integer literals, and **float64** as the default type for floating-point literals.

Type suffixes can be used to explicitly control the size and signedness of an integer literal, or to select a different floating-point precision.

<br />

## Arrays

Arrays in Cyrus are fixed-size sequences of elements. Their size must be known at compile time, similar to C arrays.

```cyrus
var name = Type[capacity]{element1, element2, ..., elementN};
```

Example:

```cyrus
var a = int[3]{1, 2, 3};
var b = const float64[4]{3.14, 2.71, 1.618, 0.577};
```

- The array size cannot change at runtime.
- Access elements using indexing, starting from 0.

```cyrus
printf("%d\n", a[0]);
```

<br />

## Pointers

Pointers in Cyrus behave like C pointers. They store the memory address of another variable.

```cyrus
var ptr: Type* = &variable;
```

- Type\* - pointer to a value of Type
- &variable - takes the address of a variable

Example:

```cyrus
var a: int = 10;
var b: int* = &a;

printf("%d\n", *b); // prints 10
```

Pointer arithmetic behaves like C (e.g., incrementing a pointer moves it by sizeof(Type) bytes).
